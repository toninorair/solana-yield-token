# Yield bearing token

## Initialization:

`initialize` sets up the initial yield and index, and marks the contract as initialized.

## Minting and Burning:
`mint` and `burn` functions allow minting and burning of tokens, respectively, controlled by the admin.

## Yield and Index Updates:
`set_future_yield` updates the yield and index values for future calculations.

## Helpers:
`get_cash_index`, `amount_to_principal`, `calculate_index`, and `exponent` functions handle index calculations and conversions.
